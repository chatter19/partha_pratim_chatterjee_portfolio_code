Software Engineering and Distributed Systems are my passions. In my 7 years of Software Engineering experience, I have held engineering positions across the software development lifecycle. Be it System Engineering and DevOps, Backend Engineering and Data Engineering, I have always strived towards developing an elegant and scalable solutions in each of the aforementioned roles. I am currently working as a Software Engineer for a Clinical AI startup where I build new tech to improve their 'going to market' strategies.

<!-- Data Science and Sports Analytics are my passions. My name is Ken Jee and I have been working in the data science field doing sports analytics for the last 5 years. I have held data science positions in companies ranging from startups to fortune 100 organizations. I transitioned into data science from a business and consulting background. When I was first starting out on my data science journey I was extremely lost; there were very few resources for me to learn about this field from. I decided to start making youtube videos to share my experiences and to hopefully help others get break into the data science and sports analytics fields. -->
